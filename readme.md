## Idea

#### Planner for the following

* Character Management
    * Managing characters
    * Character's build (having a text area for build details, not a full build planner)
        * Also including the build gearset (what gear you need, ties into the item manager to say what gear you need to transfer)
        * Gear-Farming Guide (Maybe pull from compendium and wiki in order to get the item drop locations)
* Managing Items between character banks, inventory, using, and shared banks
    * Drag-and-Drop interface with items
        * GONNA BE FUN TO WORK OUT
* Keeping Track of Raid Timers across characters
    * Auto-Import from the `/quest` command
    * Built-In Calendar for upcoming raids, list of what raids you would be able to run without leaving yourself without a character for raids
    * Support for having Timers (checking if you will be using a timer for a set raid)
